## What is this site about?

We feel there's a huge disconnect between [google material design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) and developers docs. After collecting feedback on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+DmytroDanylyk/posts/MJYpZq666KA) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3qm8pk/do_you_think_material_design_spec_is_not_enough/) we decided to make site with a single list of available material components and samples of their usage.

## What are you planning to cover?

We want to describe how to use and style material components with google appcompat and design libraries.

Later we will prepare tutorials of how to make widgets which are not available in google material spec / links to open source libraries.

## What is different between appcompat and design library?

* `v7 appcompat library` - provide support of material design user interface implementations  for older Android platforms.

* `design library` - provides various material design components which are not part of Android SDK.

## What version of support and design library are you targeting?

```groovy
com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.1.0
com.android.support:design:23.1.0
```
