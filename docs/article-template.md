!!! quote "From the Google material design [documentation](/https://material.io/guidelines/)"
    Always in the beginning of your article, you have to mention the section in the material design spec which talks about the component, pattern or animation that you talking about.

### How to add/implement ?

I. Try to write small steps, if possible, always accompanied by a copy-paste ready block of code.

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    ...
}
```

II. All sentences should be end with a dot [.]

III. Use the three ` symbol with the name of the language in order to highlight a block code.

```java
// block of code
```

!!! note
    This is a small note, informing that this step could be realized in a different way, or just an important note regarding the last step


### Compatibility issues

Some components, animations, patterns have different behaviors in different API version. It would be nice to write a small paragraph about it. If show images about the differences better.
